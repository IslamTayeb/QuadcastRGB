# QuadcastRGB
### About
The program (or driver, if you wish) allows changing the RGB colors of the
microphone HyperX Quadcast S just like NGenuity does. Should support all
platforms, Unix-like preferably. Only Linux tested so far.

### Features:
- *open source (GPLv3)*
- *cross-platform*
- *cli*
- *no need to run in the background*

### Things yet to be done:
- *all modes except **solid***
- *brightness & speed*
- *delay - **blink**-specific option*
- *actual installation*
- *save the previous settings*
